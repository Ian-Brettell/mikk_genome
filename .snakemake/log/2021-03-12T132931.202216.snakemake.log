WildcardError in line 55 of /hps/research1/birney/users/ian/mikk_paper/mikk_genome/code/snakemake/introgression/Snakefile:
Wildcards in params cannot be determined from output files. Note that you have to use a function to deactivate automatic wildcard expansion in params strings, e.g., `lambda wildcards: '{test}'`. Also see https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#non-file-parameters-for-rules:
